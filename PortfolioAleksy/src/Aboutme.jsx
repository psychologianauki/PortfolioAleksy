          Hello! My name is Aleksy and I am a first-year student studying
          Automation, Robotics and Industrial Informatics at Warsaw University
          of technology. I am passionate about web development and I am eager to
          pursue a career as a frontend developer. While I am still early in my
          academic journey, I have been working hard to gain practical
          experience in the field. In my spare time, I have been studying web
          development on my own, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as
          popular frontend frameworks such as React and Typescript. I have also
          completed several personal projects, including CryptoMarket and
          ToDoList, which have allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in a
          practical setting. In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly
          motivated and enthusiastic learner who is eager to take on new
          challenges and work collaboratively with others. I am a strong
          communicator and have excellent attention to detail, which allows me
          to produce high-quality work. I am excited about the opportunity to
          contribute my skills and knowledge to a team and to continue to grow
          as a developer.
